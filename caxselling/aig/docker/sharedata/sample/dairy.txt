Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are rich sources of calcium, which is essential for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. They also provide vitamin D (often fortified), which helps the body absorb calcium more effectively. This combination plays a key role in preventing bone-related conditions like osteoporosis, especially in children, adolescents, and older adults.

In addition to bone health, dairy is a high-quality source of complete protein, containing all the essential amino acids needed for muscle repair, immune function, and overall growth. Dairy products also supply important nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, vitamin B12, and riboflavin, which support heart health, nerve function, and energy metabolism. Fermented dairy products like yogurt and kefir also contain probiotics, which promote a healthy gut microbiome and improve digestion.

Dairy is also a versatile and convenient food group that can be easily incorporated into meals and snacks. From smoothies and cereals to savory dishes and desserts, dairy enhances both nutrition and flavor. When consumed in moderation and chosen wisely—such as opting for low-fat or unsweetened varieties—dairy can be a valuable part of a balanced and healthful diet.
