# Troubleshooting

This article contains troubleshooting steps for known issues. If you encounter a problem not listed here, check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/intel-retail/digital-signage/issues) board or file a new ticket after reviewing the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/intel-retail/digital-signage/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 1. Build Fails During `make build`

**Issue**

`make build` exits with an error during Docker image construction.

**Reason**

Docker Engine or Docker Compose is not installed, not running, or the host cannot reach the internet to download dependencies.

**Solution**

- Verify Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed and running:

  ```bash
  docker version
  docker compose version
  ```

- Confirm your host has internet access and that any proxy settings are correctly configured. See [Configure Docker](./get-started.md#configure-docker).

## 2. Containers Keep Restarting

**Issue**

One or more containers enter a restart loop after `make up`.

**Solution**

Check which container is restarting and review its logs:

```bash
docker ps
docker logs -f <container_name>
```

Common causes:

- Missing or incorrectly downloaded AI models. Re-run the model download steps in [Build from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md).
- Invalid `.env` values (for example, `HOST_IP` not set, or ICE server credentials not meeting length requirements).

## 3. No Advertisements Displayed in the Browser

**Issue**

The Web UI loads but no advertisements appear.

**Reason**

Detections are not reaching the Web UI via MQTT, or detected labels are not mapped in `ProductAssociations.csv`.

**Solution**

1. Confirm that PID is publishing detections to MQTT by checking PID container logs:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f <pid_container_name>
   ```

2. Verify that the labels detected by PID match entries in `web-ui/ProductAssociations.csv` (case-insensitive match).
3. Check AIG and ASe container logs for errors:

   ```bash
   docker logs -f <aig_container_name>
   docker logs -f <ase_container_name>
   ```

4. Confirm confidence and recency thresholds in `.env` are not set too restrictively (`OBJECT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `OBJECT_RECENCY_FRAME_COUNT`).

## 4. Slow Ad Generation on Low-Resource Systems

**Issue**

Ad generation is slow on low-resource systems.

**Reason**

Ad generation (AIG) runs on the GPU. When Chrome also uses GPU acceleration, the two compete for GPU resources, leaving insufficient capacity for AIG and causing slow ad generation rendering instability.

**Solution**

- Use Google Chrome.
- On low-resource systems, launch Chrome with GPU acceleration disabled:

  ```bash
  google-chrome --process-per-site --disable-plugins --disable-gpu https://localhost:5000
  ```

- Alternatively, in Chrome go to **Settings → System** and disable:
  - **Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed**
  - **Use graphics acceleration when available**

  Then relaunch Chrome.

- Verify that `HOST_IP`, `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME`, and `MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD` are correctly set in `.env`.

## 5. Model Download Fails

**Issue**

The YOLO11s or AIG model download step exits with an error.

**Solution**

- Confirm internet access and proxy settings.
- Ensure Python virtual environment creation succeeds (`python3 -m venv`).
- For Hugging Face downloads, set the `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` environment variable as documented in [Build from Source](./get-started/build-from-source.md).
- Ensure sufficient disk space (500 GB free recommended).

## 6. Video Not Rendering in Browser (MediaMTX `no space left on device`)

**Issue**

The browser page loads, but video does not render. MediaMTX logs show `no space left on device` (`ENOSPC`).

**Reason**

In this scenario, `ENOSPC` is usually not caused by hard drive capacity. It is commonly caused by exhausting Linux host resources such as inotify watches, inotify instances, open file descriptor limits, or filesystem inodes.

**Solution**

1. Confirm current inotify limits on the host:

  ```bash
  cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
  cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
  ```

2. Increase the limits by editing sysctl configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
  ```

3. Append the following values at the end of the file:

  ```text
  fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576
  fs.inotify.max_user_instances=10000
  ```

4. Apply the updated kernel parameters immediately:

  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -p
  ```

5. Redeploy the Digital Signage stack and verify MediaMTX is healthy:

  ```bash
  make up
  docker logs -f mediamtx
  ```

If needed, also verify inode availability (`df -i`) and open file limits (`ulimit -n`) on the host.

## 7. SDXL-Turbo and MiniLM Models (for AIG) Download Failed

**Issue**

The AIG model download fails with the following error:

```bash
save_model(model, path, compress_to_fp16)
RuntimeError: basic_ios::clear: iostream error
```

**Reason**

The `/tmp` partition has less than 15 GB of free space, which is required to stage model files during download.

**Solution**

Choose one of the following options:

1. Increase the available space on `/tmp` to at least 15 GB.
2. Redirect the temporary directory to your home folder by running the following commands, then re-run the model download in the same shell session:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/tmp
   export TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp
   ```
